# Science-web-journal
Please contribute to the [wiki](https://github.com/LibrEars/Science-web-journal/wiki). This project is all about collaborating! 

# Motivation
This project wants to establish a new way of scientific publishing and data handling to improve scientific workflow and save taxpayers money.

The tool to be created will combine several existing concepts 'to meet the demand for automatic information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world' in the original aim behind [the birth of the World Wide Web](http://home.cern/topics/birth-web).

For a critical discussion about todays publishing praxis see ['How The Digital Revolution Can Fix Scientific Publishing And Speed Up Discoveries'](https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/30/can-the-digital-revolution-fix-scientific-publishing-and-speed-up-discoveries/?ncid=rss)

### In a nutshell:
Why should todays publishing praxis be replaced:
 * Scientific workflow inefficient
 * Cost (submission/paywalls)
 * Delays
 * Anonymity of peer reviewers
 * Subjective selection
 * Ineffective search for results
 * Lack of available research data
 * Limited machine-readability
 * No failures published
 * Possible censorship

## What is needed for todays research?
There are things every newcomer in a field has to learn. And quite often some experiments are done independently over and over again due to the lack of an available decent transcript. The time wasted could be used for new research.
There are many impressive examples coming out of the open-source community who show how to work efficient together - fitting each to a certain task. By combining the strengths of those approaches a joint science-net for researchers would allow to collaborate in a drastically more efficient way. With the help of modern computational approaches such a science-net would allow to create an intelligent database capable of quick search, combining data for meta-studies and giving an overview of cutting edge research.

### In a nutshell:
What we need:
 * A tool to collaborate efficient
 * A systematical process of transcript
 * Intelligent databases

## Reasons to publish
### In a nutshell:
 * Scientific exchange, productivity and competition
 * Reputation and proof of own workforce
 * Knowledge conservation (transcript)

# Process of transcript
An fundamental part of science is the process of transcript. It could be simplified by systematical connecting its different stages into one integrated net. Education would benefit mostly from this. Starting from interactive wiki-books, students could read upwards the 'tree of knowledge' to their field of interest till they reach the cutting-edge research.

# Interactive wiki/ dynamic lab book
The heart of the science-web journal will be the interactive wiki or dynamic lab book (a good name has yet to be found). It will be the dayly tool of the scientist, providing the platform to insert data, evaluate them and to note down results. Combining strenghes of the wiki-concept known from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), of the [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), of version control like [git](https://git-scm.com/) and the use of an intelligent database (see [discussion](https://github.com/LibrEars/Science-web-journal/wiki#automatic-information-sharing-dataset-and-machine-readability)) enables a highly efficient workflow. It will be flexible enough to allow the user a broadband choice for choosing different texteditors and data analysing languages/tools as well standardized enough to ensure fluently collaborating. The recomended data analysing language will be Python due to its richness as a fully developed programming language, community and open-source nature.

# Level of access
## Personal access
To ensure security and privacy each scientist has an off-line database and personal interactive wiki.

## Collaborating in the workgroup
The first level of collaborating is within the workgroup. An intranet, hosted by the universities, provides an interactive workgroup-wiki and server for the structured data and drafts.

## University level and Publishing
When the group thinks something is ready to publish, it releases it into the university intranet and the open accessible net. The publication is on behalf of the University or Institute to encourage high-quality publications. A peer-review from outsides can be requested.
