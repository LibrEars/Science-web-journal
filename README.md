# Science-web-journal
The aim of the project is to design a new way of scientific data handling and publishing. Please contribute to the [wiki](https://github.com/LibrEars/Science-web-journal/wiki). This project is all about collaborating! 

# Motivation
The main motivation is to improve the scientific workflow and save taxpayers money by avoiding expense produced by nowadays structures. The idea is to combine several existing concepts for collaborating to form a network 'to meet the demand for automatic information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world' in the original aim of [the birth of the World Wide Web](http://home.cern/topics/birth-web).

For a critical discussion about todays publishing see ['How The Digital Revolution Can Fix Scientific Publishing And Speed Up Discoveries'](https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/30/can-the-digital-revolution-fix-scientific-publishing-and-speed-up-discoveries/?ncid=rss)

## In a nutshell:
 * Scientific workflow inefficient
 * Cost (submission/paywalls)
 * Delays
 * Anonymity of peer reviewers
 * Subjective selection
 * Ineffective search for results
 * Lack of available research data
 * No failures published
 * Limited machine-readability
 * Possible censorship

# Reasons to publish
## In a nutshell:
 * Scientific exchange, productivity and competition
 * Reputation and proof of own workforce
 * Knowledge conservation (transcript)

# What is needed for todays research?
## In a nutshell:
 * Collaboration
 * Intelligent databases

# Level of access
## Personal access
To ensure security and privacy each scientist has an off-line database and personal interactive wiki.

## Collaborating in the workgroup
The first level of collaborating is within the workgroup. An intranet, hosted by the universities, provides an interactive workgroup-wiki and server for the structured data and drafts.

## University level and Publishing
When the group thinks something is ready to publish, it releases it into the university intranet and the open accessible net. The publication is on behalf of the University or Institute to encourage high-quality publications. A peer-review from outsides can be requested.

## Effective search in science-net-journal

# Why should people join?
Useful in daily life due to interactive wiki, database and easy search

# Automatic open access journal

# Process of transcript
An fundamental part of science is the process of transcript. This process could be simplified by connecting its different stages into one systematical process. Education would benefit mostly from this. Starting from interactive wiki-books, students could read upwards the 'tree of knowledge' to their field of interest till they reach the cutting-edge research.
