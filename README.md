# Science-web-journal
The aim of the project is to design a new way of scientific data handling and publishing. This wiki is the starting point. While the code comes later, features and strategies are discussed here.

# Motivation
The main motivation is to improve the scientific workflow and save taxpayers money by avoiding expense produced by nowadays structures. The idea is to combine several existing concepts for collaborating to form a network 'to meet the demand for automatic information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world' in the original aim of [the birth of the World Wide Web](http://home.cern/topics/birth-web).

For a critical discussion about todays publishing see ['How The Digital Revolution Can Fix Scientific Publishing And Speed Up Discoveries'](https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/30/can-the-digital-revolution-fix-scientific-publishing-and-speed-up-discoveries/?ncid=rss)

## In short:
 * Scientific workflow inefficient
 * Cost (submission/paywalls)
 * Delays
 * Anonymity of peer reviewers
 * Subjective selection
 * Ineffective search for results
 * Lack of available research data
 * No failures published
 * Limited machine-readability
 * Possible censorship

# Reasons to publish
 * Scientific exchange, productivity and competition
 * Reputation and proof of own workforce
 * Knowledge conservation (transcript)

# What is needed for todays research?
 * Collaboration
 * Intelligent databases

# Level of access
# Why should people join?
Useful in daily life due to wiki, database and easy search

# Automatic open acces journal
# What is already out there?
(Open access and open source)
